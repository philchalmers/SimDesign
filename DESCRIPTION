Description: Provides tools to safely and efficiently organize and execute 
    Monte Carlo simulation experiments in R.
    The package controls the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo simulation experiments
    by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise workflow. The workflow safeguards against 
    common simulation coding issues, such as automatically re-simulating non-convergent results, 
    prevents inadvertently overwriting simulation files, catches error and warning messages
    during execution, implicitly supports parallel processing with high-quality random number 
    generation, and provides tools for managing high-performance computing (HPC) array jobs
    submitted to schedulers such as SLURM. For a pedagogical introduction to the package see
    Sigal and Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953>. For a more in-depth overview of 
    the package and its design philosophy see Chalmers and Adkins (2020) <doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248>.
