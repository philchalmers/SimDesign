Description: This package provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
             The tools provided control the structure and back-end of the Monte Carlo simulations
             by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The package
             attempts to handle issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results,
             supports parallel back-end computations, saves and restores temporary files,
             aggregates results across independent nodes, and provides native support for debugging.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.1)
