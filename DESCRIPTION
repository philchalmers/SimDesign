Description: Provides tools to safely and efficiently organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
    The package controls the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo simulations
    by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise workflow strategy. The workflow safeguards against 
    common simulation issues, such as re-simulating non-convergent results or inadvertantly 
    overwriting simulation files, and implicilty support parallel processsing.
    For a pedagogical introduction to the package see
    Sigal and Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.1080/10691898.2016.1246953>. For a more in-depth overview of 
    the package and its design philosophy see Chalmers and Adkins (2020) <doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248>.
