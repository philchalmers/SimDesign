Description: Provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
             The tools provided control the structure and back-end of the Monte Carlo simulations
             by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions
             control common simulation issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results,
             support parallel back-end computations, save and restore temporary files,
             aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide native support for debugging.
