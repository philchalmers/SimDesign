# Including fixed objects

R generally has a recursive strategy when attempting to find objects within functions. If an object can't be found, R will look just outside the function to see if the object can be located there, and if not, look one level higher....and so on, until it searches for the object in the user workspace. This is a strange feature to most programmers who come from other languages, and when writing simulations may cause some initially unwanted issues. This tutorial demonstrates how to make sure all required user-defined objects are visible to `SimDesign`. 

### Scoping

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
```

To demonstrate the issue, let's define two objects and a function which uses these objects. 

```{r}
obj1 <- 10
obj2 <- 20
```

When evaluated, these objects are visible to the user, and can be seen by typing in the R console by typing `ls()`. Functions which do not define objects with the same name will also be able to locate these values.

```{r}
myfun <- function(x) obj1 + obj2
myfun(1)
```

This behavior is indeed a bit strange, but it's one of R's quirks. Unfortunately, when running code in parallel across different cores these objects *will not be visible*, and therefore must be exported using other methods (e.g., in the `parallel` package this is done with `clusterExport()`). 

```{r}
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(2)
res <- try(parSapply(cl=cl, 1:4, myfun))
res
```

Exporting the objects to the cluster fixes the issue. 

```{r}
clusterExport(cl=cl, c('obj1', 'obj2'))
parSapply(cl=cl, 1:4, myfun)
```

The same reasoning above applies to functions defined in the R workspace as well, including functions defined within external R packages. Hence, in order to use functions from other packages they must either be explicitly loaded with `require()` or `library()` within the distributed code, or referenced via their Namespace with the `::` operator (e.g., `mvtnorm::rmvtnorm()`).

# Exporting objects example 

In order to make objects safely visible in `SimDesign` the strategy is very simple: wrap all desired objects into a named list, and pass this to the `fixed_objects` argument. From here, elements can be indexed using the `$` operator or `with()` function, or whatever other method may be convenient. However, this is only required for defined *objects* not *functions* --- `SimDesign` automatically makes user-defined functions available across all nodes.

Note: An alternative approach is simply to define/source the objects within the respective `SimDesign` functions, that way they will clearly be visible at runtime. The following approach is really only useful when the defined objects contain a large amount of code.

```{r}
library(SimDesign)
#SimDesign_functions(comments = FALSE)

### Define design conditions and number of replications
Design <- expand.grid(N = c(10, 20, 30))
replications <- 1000

# define custom functions and objects (or use source() to read these in from an external file)
SD <- 2
my_gen_fun <- function(n, sd) rnorm(n, sd = sd)
my_analyse_fun <- function(x) c(p = t.test(x)$p.value)
fixed_objects <- list(SD=SD)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate <- function(condition, fixed_objects = NULL) {
    # use with() to use 'SD' instead of 'fixed_objects$SD'
    ret <- with(fixed_objects, my_gen_fun(condition$N, sd=SD))
    ret
}

Analyse <- function(condition, dat, fixed_objects = NULL, parameters = NULL) {
    ret <- my_analyse_fun(dat)
    ret
}

Summarise <- function(condition, results, fixed_objects = NULL, parameters_list = NULL) {
    ret <- EDR(results, alpha = .05)
    ret
}

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Run the simulation
results <- runSimulation(Design, replications, verbose=FALSE, fixed_objects=fixed_objects,
                         generate=Generate, analyse=Analyse, summarise=Summarise, edit='none')
results
```

By placing objects in a list and passing this to `fixed_objects`, the objects are safely made available to all relevant functions. Furthermore, running this code in parallel is also valid. Remember, this is only required for R objects NOT user-defined functions.

```{r}
results <- runSimulation(Design, replications, verbose=FALSE, fixed_objects=fixed_objects,
                         generate=Generate, analyse=Analyse, summarise=Summarise, edit='none',
                         parallel = TRUE)
results
```
