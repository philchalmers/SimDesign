# SimDesign

Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs

## Installation

To install the Github version of the package with `devtools`, type the following (assuming you have already installed the `devtools` package from CRAN).

```r
library('devtools')
install_github('philchalmers/SimDesign')
```

## Getting started

Load the package and read the documentation in `runSimulation()`

```r
library(SimDesign)
help(runSimulation)
```

Go through the worked example to understand what the function inputs require, and try your luck walking through a debugging process though the `edit` argument (also very handy for writing the initial functions if you are comfortable with the debugging environment).

For additional information and instructions about how to use the package, refer to the examples on the [wiki](https://github.com/philchalmers/SimDesign/wiki).
