# SimDesign

Code for organizing Monte Carlo simulations in R

## Installation

SimDesign is not on CRAN, therefore you will have to use the `devtools` package to install it from Github.

```r
library('devtools')
install_github('philchalmers/SimDesign')
```

## Getting started

Load the package and read the documentation in `runSimulation()`

```r
library(SimDesign)
help(runSimulation)
```

Go through the worked example to understand what the function inputs require, and try your luck walking through a debugging process though the `edit` argument (also very handy for writing the initial functions if you are comfortable with the debugging environment).

For additional information and instructions refer to the examples on the [wiki](https://github.com/philchalmers/mirt/wiki).
